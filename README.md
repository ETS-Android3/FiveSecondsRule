# Commit rules
* Must write number of issue (#number) you commit at first place 

  For example: `"#12 update commit rules README.md"`
* Use the present simple tense, imperative 

  For example: `"add", not "added", "adds"`
* Write first word with a small letter 

  For example: `"add", not "Add"`
* Don't add extra punctuation marks in the end of the commit 

  For example: `"add function", not "add function."`
* First write what you did, then you did with what; and then the details in details field
* Commit contains one completed change
* If number of letters is bigger then 50 than you should add empty string after main commit. After empty string it's body and before empty string it's title 

  The example, how to use commit rules:    
    ```
